The following GitHub Actions workflow automates testing, building Docker images, and deploying to a server. 

A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that integrates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices. It enables teams to:
Build and test code automatically after each commit.
Deploy applications reliably and quickly to production or staging environments.
CI/CD pipelines help streamline the software development lifecycle, making it faster, safer, and more efficient.

Because CI/CD pipelines improve development efficiency and guarantee high-quality software, faster delivery is assured. It saves teams from the hassle of release processes by automating testing and deployment processes so that they can focus on building features.
